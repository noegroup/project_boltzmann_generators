abstract = {An expression is derived for the equilibrium free energy difference between two configurations of a system, in terms of an ensemble of finite-time measurements of the work performed in parametrically switching from one configuration to the other. Two well-known identities emerge as limiting cases of this result. [S0031-9007(97)02845-7] PACS numbers: 05.70.Ln, 87.10. + e, 82.20.Wt Consider a finite classical system in contact with a heat reservoir. A central concept in thermodynamics is that of the work performed on such a system, when some external parameters of the system are made to change with time. (These parameters may represent, for instance, the strength of an external field, or the volume of space within which the system is confined, or, more abstractly, some particle-particle interactions which are turned on or off during the course of a molecular dynamics simulation.) When the parameters are changed infinitely slowly along some path g from an initial point A to a final point B in parameter space, then the total work W performed on the system is equal to the Helmholtz free energy difference DF between the initial and final configurations [1]: W DF F B 2 F A. [Here F A F B refers to the equilibrium free energy of the system, with the parameters held fixed at A B.] By contrast, when the parameters are switched along g at a finite rate, then W will depend on the microscopic initial conditions of the system and reservoir, and will, on average, exceed DF: W {\$} DF. (1) The overbar denotes an average over an ensemble of measurements of W , where each measurement is made after first allowing the system and reservoir to equilibrate at temperature T , with the parameters fixed at A. (The path g from A to B, and the rate at which the parameters are switched along this path, remain unchanged from one measurement to the next.) Note that the right side of Eq. (1) still refers to the equilibrium free energy difference F B 2 F A. The difference W 2 DF is just the dissipated work, W diss , associated with the increase of entropy during an irreversible process. Equation (1) is an inequality. By contrast, the new result derived in this paper is the following equality: exp2bW exp2bDF , (2a) or, equivalently, DF 2b 21 ln exp2bW , (2b) where b 1k B T. This result, which is independent of both the path g from A to B, and the rate at which the parameters are switched along the path, is surprising: It says that we can extract equilibrium information DF from the ensemble of nonequilibrium (finite-time) measurements described above. Before proceeding with the proof of Eq. (2), we establish notation and then relate Eq. (2) to two well-known equilibrium identities for DF. Since we have fixed our attention on a particular path g in parameter space, it will be convenient to henceforth view the system as parametrized by a single quantity l, which increases from 0 to 1 as we travel from A to B along g. Let z q, p denote a point in the phase space of the system, and let H l z denote the Hamiltonian for the system, parametrized by the value of l. Next, let Z l denote the partition function, let {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} {\textperiodcentered} l denote a canonical average, and let F l 2b 21 ln Z l denote the free energy, all with respect to the Hamiltonian H l and the temperature T. We are interested in the following scenario , which we will refer to as "the switching process": The system evolves, in contact with a heat reservoir, as the value of l is switched from 0 to 1, over a total switching time t s. Without loss of generality, assume a constant switching rate, l t 21 s. For a given realization of the switching process, the evolution of the system is described by a (effectively stochastic) trajectory zt, and the work performed on the system is the time integral of l≠H l ≠l along this trajectory: W Z t s 0 dt l ≠H l ≠l zt. (3) Now imagine an ensemble of realizations of the switching process (with g and t s fixed), with initial conditions for the system and reservoir generated from a canonical ensemble at temperature T. Then W may be computed for each trajectory zt in the ensemble, and the overbars appearing in Eqs. (1) and (2) indicate an average over the distribution of values of W thus obtained. In the limiting cases of infinitely slow and infinitely fast switching of the external parameters, we know explicitly the ensemble distribution of values of W , and thus can readily check the validity of our central result. In the slow limit t s ! `, the system is in quasistatic equilibrium with the reservoir throughout the switching process, hence W R 1 0 dl≠H l ≠l l for every trajectory in the 2690 0031-90079778(14)2690(4){\$}10.00},

abstract = {We propose as a generalization of an idea of Ruelle to describe turbulent fluid flow a chaotic hypothesis for reversible dissipative many particle systems in nonequilibrium stationary states in general. This implies an extension of the zeroth law of thermodynamics to non equilibrium states and it leads to the identification of a unique distribution {\$}\backslashm{\$} describing the asymptotic properties of the time evolution of the system for initial data randomly chosen with respect to a uniform distribution on phase space. For conservative systems in thermal equilibrium the chaotic hypothesis implies the ergodic hypothesis. We outline a procedure to obtain the distribution {\$}\backslashm{\$}: it leads to a new unifying point of view for the phase space behavior of dissipative and conservative systems. The chaotic hypothesis is confirmed in a non trivial, parameter--free, way by a recent computer experiment on the entropy production fluctuations in a shearing fluid far from equilibrium. Similar applications to other models are proposed, in particular to a model for the Kolmogorov--Obuchov theory for turbulent flow.},

Vfe prove that the measure of those phases that generate second law violating phase space trajectories vanishes exponentially with time. PACS number(s): 05.20.-y, 47.10.+ g For reversible deterministic N-particle thermostatted systems, we examine the question of why it is so difficult to find initial microstates that will, at long times, under the application of an external dissipative field, lead to second law violating nonequilbirum steady states. In reversible systems, for each second law satisfying trajectory there is by definition a second law violating antitrajectory [1]. It is also known that antitrajectories are less stable mechanically than their conjugate second law satisfying trajectories [1, 2]. It might appear that microscopic mechanical stability thus provides an explanation for the validity of the second law. We show, however, that this argument is not directly relevant to the validity of the second law. {\%}hen trajectories are followed essentially exactly and mechanical instabilities have not yet become large enough to have observable consequences on system dynamics , second law satisfying trajectories are still observed overwhelmingly often. Vfe show that the second law is observed overwhelmingly often because at equilib rium, the measure of those initial states that subsequently lead to second law violating trajectories vanishes exponentially with respect to the time over which these violations occur. To save space we discuss these matters with reference to thermostatted planar Couette flow. Analogous arguments and conclusions can be given for other transport processes. Thermostatted electrical conduction is comparatively simple.},

abstract = {The use of non-Hamiltonian dynamical systems to perform molecular dynamics simulation studies is becoming standard. However, the lack of a sound statistical mechanical foundation for non-Hamiltonian systems has caused numerous misconceptions about the phase space distribution functions generated by these systems to appear in the literature. Recently, a rigorous classical statistical mechanical theory of non-Hamiltonian systems has been derived, ͓M. E. Tuckerman, et al., Europhys. Lett. 45, 149 ͑1999͔͒. In this paper, the new theoretical formulation is employed to develop the non-Hamiltonian generalization of the usual Hamiltonian based statistical mechanical phase space principles. In particular, it is shown how the invariant phase space measure and the complete sets of conservation laws of the dynamical system can be combined with the generalized Liouville equation for non-Hamiltonian systems to produce a well defined expression for the phase space distribution function. The generalization provides a systematic, controlled procedure for designing non-Hamiltonian molecular dynamics algorithms which can be used to generate nonmicrocanonical ensembles, stationary nonequilibrium flows, and/or the dynamics of constrained systems. In light of this new general analysis, molecular dynamics algorithms for the canonical and isothermal–isobaric ensembles are examined, potential difficulties are illuminated, and the limitations of previous theoretical treatments are elucidated.},
